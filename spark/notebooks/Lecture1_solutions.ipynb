    "Imagine you are interested in working on a very large dataset, at the scale of hundreds of Terabytes or even Petabytes.\n",
    "As discussed in the Data Management part of the course, a large horizontally scalable storage solution is going to be necessary to host the entire dataset.\n",

    "* Data are distributed over many nodes, and collecting all data in one node (e.g., loading the entire dataset into a single computer memory) would be impossible.\n",
    "* Not all data in the entire dataset is necessarily going to be relevant to solve your problem. You may want to first load all data, explore it, filter it, and preprocess it.\n",
    "* Then, you may want to move to the actual data analysis phase and possibly apply machine learning models on the preprocessed data. However, even the preprocessed data may not fit into your local machine's memory, and once again, a distributed system is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you would like to do is to run the pre-processing on the nodes of the cluster where the data is distributed, and return only the high-level quantities that will be used in the analysis, or even the end result of the entire analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the core concept of distributed computing frameworks like Hadoop and Spark: the code/execution goes to the data, rather than the data coming to the machine where the code resides (data locality). "

    "This is not a sizeable dataset in this specific example, but it might be the case in a real-life scenario, where you may have lots of records stored in a distributed cluster.\n",
    "Returning the entire dataset just to produce a histogram is extremely inconvenient, as it implies large data transfers from the executors to the driver, and finally to the client (possibly resulting in getting out of the driver's memory)._\n",
    "\n",
    "_What you should be doing instead is to evaluate the histogram remotely and in parallel, and return the histogram as a set of bins and counts.\n",
    "This way the data transfer from the executors to the driver is minimized, avoiding possible issues._\n",

    "_You should be able to write a Map-Reduce function to create a histogram (consider this an **Extra-exercise**), but Spark is also providing some built-in functions to compute simple histograms remotely._"
